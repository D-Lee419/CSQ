# CSQï¼šA Chinese Science Question dataset with Rich Discipline Properties in  adaptive problem-solving process generation
This is the repository of the paper *A Chinese Science Question dataset with Rich Discipline Properties in adaptive problem-solving process generation*, we released the Chinese Science Question (CSQ) dataset, which consists of a benchmark set and a training set designed to evaluate and improve the ability of LLMs to solve science questions. We released the Chinese Science Question (CSQ) dataset, which consists of a baseline set and a training set to assess and improve LLMs' ability to solve science questions. The CSQ dataset contains more than 12,000 high-quality samples, with a variety of question types (e.g., multiple-choice and true-false multiple-choice), and a rich set of subject matter attributes across four disciplines and many topics, such as life sciences, physical sciences, earth and space sciences, and technology and engineering. and engineering, spanning across six grades in Chinese primary schools. We demonstrated that the CSQ and its extensive annotations can be used to fine-tune the model. Both automated and manual assessments confirmed this, particularly in terms of generating question-solving processes that match students' grade level.

We uploaded the Science Skills Framework. The CSQ dataset will be released after our paper is online, until then any queries can be directed to us at leed@mails.ccnu.edu.cn
